in code you can find "Aigenerator.aiNumberGenerator()" it is a custom made random number generator you can replace it with java's random module 
yeah this is a famous indian game like i don't know about other places but this was introduced to me by my friend and beign an enthusiastic coder myself thought why can't i code that game in java using oops and all that 
so yeah you can use it and wish you luck
